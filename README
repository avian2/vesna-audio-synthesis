This is a small demonstration of a wide-band analog FM signal transmission
using the CC1101 transceiver.

An audio signal is generated using a 6-channel wavetable synthesizer
implemented in software at 25 kHz sample rate and 4-bit resolution.

Audio signal is then upconverted to an 400 kbps binary stream using a
delta-sigma modulator and sent to the CC1101 using a bit-banging
protocol through GPIO lines.

CC1101 is configured for 2FSK, infinite packet length. It is tuned to 864 MHz
(European channel for unlicensed wireless microphones) and the FM deviation is
set to conform to typical studio microphone transmissions.

As is, this demo requires a VESNA wireless sensor node with SNE-ISMTV-868
expansion. It should be easy to adapt to any platform with the CC1101
transceiver.

How to use
==========

To compile

$ make

To run unit tests (you need Unity installed in a directory along side
vesna-audio-synthesis)

$ make test

To flash to a VESNA node using OpenOCD and Olimex ARM-USB-OCD:

$ make vesna-audio-synthesis.u


If you don't have a hardware FM receiver for the UHF range there are GNU Radio
examples in the receiver/ subdirectory that can be used with USRP or OsmoSDR
devices to receive and demodulate the transmission.


You can also run the demo on any Linux computer using an ALSA device instead
of the CC1101 transceiver:

$ cd tests
$ make vesna-audio-synthesis-host
$ ./vesna-audio-synthesis-host | aplay -r25000
